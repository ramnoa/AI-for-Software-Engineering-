🧠 Mini E-Learning Platform
📘 Overview

The Mini E-Learning Platform is a lightweight front-end prototype that simulates the core experience of an online learning system. It allows users to browse a list of available courses, view detailed course information, and mark courses as completed — all built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project was vibe coded, meaning it was crafted intuitively and creatively without rigid frameworks — guided by inspiration, flow, and functionality.

🚀 Features

Course Listing: Displays at least three available courses.

Course Details: Click on any course to view its full description.

Mark as Completed: Track learning progress by marking finished courses.

(Optional) Add login or sign-up functionality for personalized use.

💫 Vibe Coding Philosophy

This project was developed through vibe coding — a freeform approach where creativity, logic, and intuition work together.
Rather than following a rigid framework or detailed plan, each element was built organically to reflect flow and inspiration during development.

🌱 Future Enhancements
